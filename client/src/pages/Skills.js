              I speak fluent <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>,
              after having written thousands of lines of both. This allows me to
              create solutions that are responsive, cross-browser and meet
              accessibility standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know the ins and outs of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, including
              its most modern syntax. It is the programming language I
              specialize in, being able to write both functional and
              object-oriented code. I understand the language on a deep level,
              which allows me to adapt quickly to existing codebases.

              I have worked with <strong>front end frameworks</strong>, most
              notably
              <strong>React</strong>, allowing me to easily and quickly create

            <p>
              I can use UI frameworks such as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and
              <strong>Tailwind</strong> to complete projects faster, and use
              design systems that would ensure a consistent look of the
              interface, while keeping everything responsive.

              Kanban boards and communicators such as Microsoft Teams to aid me
